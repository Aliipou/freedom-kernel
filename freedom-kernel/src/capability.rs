//! Capability algebra — the closed, finite vocabulary of authority operations.
//!
//! # Hard constraints (enforced by CI)
//!
//! This file must stay:
//! - **Finite** — all variants are enumerated at compile time; no open extension points
//! - **Closed** — exhaustive enums only; no trait objects, no dynamic dispatch
//! - **Algebraic** — pure data (enums + Copy); no logic, no state, no side effects
//! - **Self-contained** — zero project imports (`use crate::` is forbidden here)
//! - **Small** — hard ceiling of 150 LOC (CI-enforced)
//!
//! # What this file must never become
//!
//! - A policy DSL (no evaluation, no rule matching)
//! - A semantic interpreter (no string analysis, no NLP, no heuristics)
//! - A contextual reasoner (no runtime state, no environment queries)
//! - A plugin system (no trait impls for external types, no open variants)
//!
//! The only permitted impls are `Display` and boundary-only `from_str` for `Operation`.
//! Every other behavior belongs outside this file.
