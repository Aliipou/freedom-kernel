# What Freedom Kernel Cannot Formally Guarantee

**This document comes from strength, not weakness.**
seL4 documented the same boundary. A system that claims to prove everything proves nothing.

## Formally Undecidable

### 1. Infinite-Horizon Plan Safety

By Rice's theorem, no algorithm can decide whether an arbitrary
infinite sequence of PERMITTED actions leads to an unsafe state.

**Response:** `verify_plan()` operates on a bounded plan prefix of depth n.  
**Guarantee:** no prefix of length ≤ n violates temporal invariants (IFC taint, forbidden flags).  
**Gap:** the range (n, ∞) is not covered by formal proof.  
**Kani harness:** `prop_plan_permitted_means_no_forbidden_flags` verifies depth ≤ KANI_UNWIND.

---

### 2. Semantic Intent Verification

The kernel verifies typed predicates, not intent.

```
Action("read-research", bot, resources_read=[paper])
```

If `bot` has a valid read claim on `paper`, this is **PERMITTED** —  
even if "research" is a pretext for something harmful.

The kernel cannot distinguish genuine intent from pretext. Safety requires
the ownership graph to accurately reflect the human owner's actual intent.

**Mitigation:** audit log + human review of high-confidence contested claims.

---

### 3. Axiom Soundness

The kernel enforces A1–A7. Whether A1–A7 are the *correct* axioms is
a philosophical question outside the scope of formal verification.

The kernel is sound **relative to** A1–A7. It cannot verify A1–A7 themselves.

---

### 4. Goal-Intent Alignment

A plan that passes `verify_goal_tree()` is structurally permitted under
the kernel gate. Whether the plan *achieves what the human intended* is
undecidable — it depends on the human's actual preferences, not just their
declared ownership graph.

**Mitigation:** compass extension (`extensions/compass.py`) scores plan alignment
with declared terminal goals. This is heuristic, not formal.
