# Freedom Kernel — Formal Semantics

This document defines what the kernel **formally guarantees**, what it **does not guarantee**,
and why those boundaries exist. It is intended for security engineers evaluating adoption, not
general users.

The gap between *formal-looking* and *formally specified* is dangerous. This document is the
attempt to close that gap honestly.

## What the Kernel IS

The kernel is a **static authority checker** over a typed ownership graph.

It answers exactly one question:

> Given a set of registered rights claims, does agent A currently hold sufficient authority
> to perform operation O on resource R?

This is a **graph reachability + lattice membership** problem. It is decidable, deterministic,
and O(n) in the number of claims.

---

## Formal Model

### 1. Entities and Resources

```
Entity  := (name: String, kind: HUMAN | MACHINE)
Resource := (name: String, type: ResourceType, scope: String, is_public: Bool)
```

`Resource` is a **named, typed, scoped identifier**. The kernel makes no claims about the
ontological status of what a resource represents. What counts as a resource is determined by
the integrating system, not the kernel. The kernel enforces claims on whatever resources are
registered.

**Implication**: The kernel does not and cannot adjudicate:
- Whether an AI model trained on Alice's data "owns" the resulting weights
- Whether copied embeddings of Alice's text constitute her property
- Whether inferred knowledge derived from Bob's private data belongs to Bob
- Whether generated artifacts (LLM outputs) are owned by the prompter or the model operator

These are unresolved problems in digital property theory. The kernel takes resource definitions
as given from the registering authority (a human operator) and enforces them consistently.

### 2. Rights Claims

```
RightsClaim := {
    holder:       Entity,
    resource:     Resource,
    can_read:     Bool,
    can_write:    Bool,
    can_delegate: Bool,
    confidence:   ℝ ∩ [0,1],
    expires_at:   Option[Timestamp]
}
```

A claim is **valid** iff `confidence > 0` and `now < expires_at` (or `expires_at` is None).

The `confidence` field is not a probability. It is an **authority weight**: a measure of how
contested or time-limited the claim is. A confidence of 1.0 means the claim is uncontested and
perpetual in the registry. A confidence of 0.6 means the claim exists but has lower precedence.

### 3. The Ownership Graph

```
Registry := (claims: Set[RightsClaim], owners: Map[Machine → Human])
```

The registry is a **static snapshot** — it represents authority at the moment of verification.
It is not a temporal database and does not model:
- Authority changes that occur *during* action execution
- Side effects of actions on the registry itself
- Concurrent modifications to the registry

### 4. The Delegation Lattice

Delegation is **strictly attenuating**:

```
delegate(claim C, delegated_by E) is valid iff:
  ∃ best_claim B ∈ Registry where:
    B.holder = E
    B.resource = C.resource
    B.can_delegate = true
    B.is_valid()
  AND C.can_read  ≤ B.can_read      (cannot grant read you don't have)
  AND C.can_write ≤ B.can_write     (cannot grant write you don't have)
  AND C.confidence ≤ B.confidence   (cannot grant higher confidence than you hold)
```

**Multi-hop delegation** (Alice → BotA → BotB → ToolAgent) is supported. Each hop must
satisfy the above constraint. The chain is enforced by calling `delegate()` at each step;
the kernel does not automatically propagate delegation — each link must be explicit.

**What is NOT specified**: What "legally propagates" in terms of accountability, liability,
or moral responsibility when a chain of machines causes harm. The kernel enforces authority
boundaries; it does not model legal or ethical responsibility chains.

### 5. The Verification Gate

```
Permitted(action A, registry R) :=
    ¬SovereigntyFlags(A)
  ∧ (A.actor ∈ Machines → HasOwner(A.actor, R))
  ∧ (∀ r ∈ A.resources_read  : CanAct(A.actor, r, read,  R))
  ∧ (∀ r ∈ A.resources_write : CanAct(A.actor, r, write, R))
  ∧ (∀ h ∈ A.governs_humans  : A.actor ∉ Machines)
```

Where `SovereigntyFlags(A)` is true if any of the 10 forbidden flags is set on A.

This is a **closed-form, decidable predicate**. Given a fixed registry snapshot, every
`verify(action)` call is deterministic and terminating.

---

## What verify_plan Actually Checks

`verify_plan(actions)` performs **independent per-action authority checking** on a list of
actions, with one additional rule: if any action triggers a sovereignty flag, the remaining
actions are cancelled.

It formally checks:
```
∀ i ∈ [0..n]: Permitted(actions[i], R)
  subject to: if ∃ j < i : SovereigntyFlag(actions[j]) → ∀ k > j : ¬Permitted(actions[k])
```

**It does NOT check**:
- **Emergent behavior**: actions that are individually permitted but collectively cause harm
- **State mutation**: whether action[i] changes the resource landscape for action[i+1]
- **Indirect effects**: side channels, information leakage, or out-of-band resource acquisition
- **Goal achievement**: whether the plan achieves the stated objective
- **Hidden subgoals**: latent intents embedded in the argument or description fields

**Why this limitation is not a bug**: Checking emergent behavior of arbitrary action sequences
is equivalent to halting problem reduction in the general case. The kernel is designed to be a
*necessary condition checker*, not a *sufficient condition checker*. A PERMITTED result means
"the agent holds the claimed authority." It does not mean "this sequence of actions is safe."

The verify_plan limitation is the primary reason this kernel is *not sufficient* for AGI
alignment by itself — it is a substrate on which alignment infrastructure can be built, not
a complete alignment solution.

## What the TLA+ Spec Models

`formal/freedom_kernel.tla` specifies the five core safety invariants:

| Invariant | What it says | What it does NOT say |
|---|---|---|
| `SovereigntyAlwaysBlocks` | Any action with a sovereignty flag is denied | Whether sovereignty flags are set correctly by the caller |
| `OwnerlessMachineBlocked` | Machines without registered owners cannot act | Whether machine-human ownership assignments are correct |
| `AttenuationHolds` | Delegated confidence ≤ delegator's confidence | Whether the initial confidence values are correct |
| `MachineWithinOwnerScope` | Machines can't access resources their owners can't access | Whether owner scopes are correctly defined |

**Status**: The TLA+ spec is **research-grade**. The invariants are stated and the state
transitions are modeled. The spec has NOT been:
- Run through TLC model checker to exhaustion
- Verified with Apalache (symbolic model checker)
- Mechanically proven in a proof assistant (Lean, Coq, Isabelle)

The gap between "stated as THEOREM" and "mechanically verified" is significant. The theorems
are stated as targets, not as proven results.

**Honest label**: The TLA+ spec is a **specification document with stated invariants**, not a
**verified formal proof**. It is useful for communicating the intended properties and detecting
obvious counterexamples. It is not a guarantee.

## Explicit Non-Goals of the Kernel

The following problems are **out of scope** by design. Including them would violate the
"tiny verifier" principle and make the kernel unauditable:

| Problem | Why out of scope |
|---|---|
| Ownership semantics for non-rival digital goods | Requires digital property theory; kernel takes resource definitions as given |
| Emergent behavior of action sequences | Undecidable in general |
| Indirect effects and information flow | Requires information-flow type system (IFC); different problem |
| Temporal authority (during-action changes) | Requires temporal logic extension; different tool |
| Moral/legal responsibility chains | Outside formal systems entirely |
| Intent inference from natural language | Requires NLP; explicitly kept out of the gate |
| Goal alignment | Requires behavioral specification; this kernel is a substrate only |
| Concurrent registry modification | Requires distributed consensus; registry is assumed static per-call |

---

## What Would Make This Formally Complete

Honest path to "formally specified":

1. **Model check the TLA+ spec**: Run TLC on a 3-entity, 3-resource, depth-5 instance.
   This would validate the invariants mechanically rather than by inspection.

2. **Specify information-flow semantics**: Add an optional IFC layer that tracks `can_read`
   as a security label and verifies non-interference. This is the missing piece for
   "no information leaks" guarantees.

3. **Formalize delegation transitivity**: Prove or disprove that the delegation lattice forms
   a bounded distributive lattice under composition. This would let you reason about chains
   algebraically.

4. **Prove the Rust engine correct**: Use a Rust verification tool (Creusot, Prusti, Kani)
   to verify that `engine.rs` implements `Permitted(a, R)` exactly as specified above.
   This closes the gap between the mathematical spec and the running code.

5. **Define resource scope semantics**: Formally specify what it means for a resource path
   `/data/alice/` to "contain" a sub-resource `/data/alice/file.csv`. Currently this is
   application-layer convention, not kernel-enforced.

Items 1 and 3 are tractable in the short term. Items 2, 4, and 5 require dedicated research.

## Summary

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| Deterministic verification | ✓ True |
| Formally specified invariants | ✓ Stated; not mechanically verified |
| Attenuation enforced | ✓ True for registered delegation chains |
| Sovereignty flags unconditionally block | ✓ True |
| Complete ownership semantics | ✗ Out of scope; application-layer concern |
| Behavioral plan verification | ✗ Not provided; see verify_plan limitations |
| Formally verified implementation | ✗ Not yet; TLC model checking is the next step |
| Sufficient for AGI alignment | ✗ Necessary substrate only |

The kernel is strongest when understood as what it is: a **deterministic, auditable,
capability-checked authority gate** — not a complete safety system. Systems built on top of
this kernel can achieve stronger guarantees by composing it with behavioral monitors,
information-flow systems, and formal plan verifiers.
