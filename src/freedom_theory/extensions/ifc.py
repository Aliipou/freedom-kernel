"""
extensions/ifc.py — Information Flow Control for the Freedom Kernel.

Implements Bell-LaPadula style non-interference as an extension on top of
the permission kernel. The kernel (Permitted) is a necessary precondition;
the IFC checker is a separate correctness pass on top.

The kernel answers: does the agent hold the authority?
The IFC checker answers: would this sequence of reads/writes leak information
from a higher security label to a lower one?

Usage:
    from freedom_theory.extensions.ifc import NonInterferenceChecker, SecurityLattice

    checker = NonInterferenceChecker(verifier)
    checker.check_plan(actions)   # raises IFCViolation on downward flow
