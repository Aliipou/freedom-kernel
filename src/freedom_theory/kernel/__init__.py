Freedom Kernel — capability-security gate for agentic AI.

LLM → Action IR → FreedomVerifier → Execute | Block

  entities  — typed data (Entity, Resource, RightsClaim)
  registry  — ownership graph + conflict detection
  verifier  — deterministic gate (verify, verify_plan, verify_signed)
  context   — ExecutionContext (bounded authority scope)
  goals     — GoalNode + verify_goal_tree (Stage 2)
