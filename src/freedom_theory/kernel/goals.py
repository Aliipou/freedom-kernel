"""
Goal tree verification (Stage 2).

AGI systems decompose goals into subgoals recursively. Every subgoal must
stay within the authority scope of its parent goal. This module provides the
GoalNode type and verify_goal_tree function that check the entire goal
decomposition against the ownership graph.

The key invariant: authority cannot grow as you go deeper in the goal tree.
A subgoal cannot require resources its parent goal doesn't already have.
